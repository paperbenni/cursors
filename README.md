# cursors

install
```sh
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paperbenni/cursors/master/install.sh | bash
```

A bunch of x cursors. Used for https://paperbenni.github.io/suckless/  
I didn't create these,
I just tweaked some of them and host a repo so you don't have to clone the entirety of paper-icon-theme just for the cursors
